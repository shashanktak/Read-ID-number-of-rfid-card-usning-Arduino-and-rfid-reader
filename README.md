# Read-ID-number-of-rfid-card-usning-Arduino-and-rfid-reader
In this projects , we will perform c code in Arduino IDE and see that what is the ID number of each RFID card and then we can use it later.

Before implementing this projects you must have this tool & Software

DWONLOAD APPLICATION FROM :- https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

After doing this you must have this tool's.....................................

              ARDUINO UNO 
              RFID READER
After buying this tool you can perform this task , and upload my given code to perform the work.


/* Pin layout should be as follows:
 * Signal     
              Arduino Uno          MFRC522 board(RFID)
* Reset               9             RST
* SPI SS              10            SDA
* SPI MOSI            11            MOSI
* SPI MISO            12            MISO
* SPI SCK             13            SCK
 
 
 * voltage 3.3v
